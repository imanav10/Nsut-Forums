      <h2>About Developers</h2>
      <p>My name is Manav, a dedicated first-year undergraduate student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at NSUT Delhi. I proudly hold the roll number 2023UEA6505.
        Passionate about technology and its applications, I enthusiastically embarked on this project as a submission for the GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) society. With a goal to merge creativity and innovation, I am committed to crafting solutions that can make a positive impact on the world.
        Throughout this project, I have honed my skills, delving into various aspects of software development, problem-solving, and collaboration. It's been an enriching journey, and I look forward to leveraging the knowledge and experiences gained in future projects.
        I believe in the power of community and the transformative potential of technology. Being part of the GDSC society has allowed me to connect with like-minded individuals, and I'm eager to continue contributing to the tech ecosystem, striving for excellence and continuous growth.
        Together, let's innovate and create a brighter future through the fusion of knowledge, passion, and collaboration.❤️
